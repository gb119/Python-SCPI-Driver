# Python-SCPI-Driver
A Python package for interfacing with SCPI instruments

This package provides several classes to support doing SCPI over telnet interfaces.

It was hacked together to support the use of a Keithley 6221 and 2182A for A STXM run in November 2018 and redone for a further run in
September 2019.
